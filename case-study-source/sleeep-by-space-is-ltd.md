Our partner Vincent Lau, lead the development of reservation systems and IoT integrations of the award winning sleeping pod, during his time with Space is Ltd.

SLEEEP is a capsule hotel in Central, Hong Kong. It is a space for people to recharge in this city that never sleeps.

Being CTO=the Tech Guy, Vincent’s work is to make technologies creating the experience, replacing friction with warmth. Booking app - EXP to reserve your next sleeping timeslot right away. QR Code as key to entry, with your SLPer(capsule) & locker then welcoming you with blinks. Slowly glowing light as alarm to adjust you from your sleep cycles.
