Being CTO=the Tech Guy, Vincent’s work is to make technologies creating the experience, replacing friction with warmth. Booking app - EXP to reserve your next sleeping timeslot right away. QR Code as key to entry, with your SLPer(capsule) & locker then welcoming you with blinks. Slowly glowing light as alarm to adjust you from your sleep cycles.
